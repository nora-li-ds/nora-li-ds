# Hi, I’m Nora (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

I study how harmful online behaviours escalate into real-world economic harm.
My work combines NLP, network science, and agent-based modelling to analyse financial crime, online fraud, and cryptocurrency laundering pathways.

I am currently exploring how online scam escalation signals correspond to on-chain laundering flows, and how computational models can support threat assessment.

## Research Themes

· Online behavioural threat pathways
Modelling escalation patterns in scam communication and digital manipulation.

· Graph-based AML and cryptocurrency tracing
Using transaction networks, risk propagation models, and GNNs.

· Computational risk assessment
NLP, anomaly detection, and temporal models for early-warning indicators.

## Academic Journey
My path into crime science has been shaped by a mix of quantitative training and applied motivation.  

- During my BSc in Statistics at Lancaster, I developed a strong foundation in probability, inference, and modelling, and became interested in how quantitative methods can be used to study crime and social phenomena.  
- At Imperial, in my MSc in Environmental Data Science & Machine Learning, I strengthened my technical skills in data science and explored deep learning approaches such as conditional GANs (CGANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). This experience gave me confidence in handling complex datasets and broadened my perspective on advanced algorithms.  
- Now at UCL, in the MSc Crime Science with Data Science, my training emphasises crime prevention, cybercrime, and research design. Alongside this, I am independently developing technical projects—such as financial crime detection on the Elliptic dataset and agent-based simulations of scam diffusion—to bridge advanced modelling with real-world crime problems.  

This journey reflects my continuing interest in linking rigorous data science methods with practical challenges in financial crime and security.

## Research Prototypes

- **[Elliptic AML Analysis](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/elliptic-aml-analysis)**  
  *Goal:* Detect illicit Bitcoin transactions on the Elliptic dataset.  
  *Skills:* Data wrangling, feature engineering, ML pipelines (LogReg, RF, XGBoost).  
  *Current status:* Baseline ML completed, highlighting limits of tabular features.  
  *Next:* Extend with graph neural networks (GCN, GraphSAGE) and temporal graph modelling.  

- **[Agent-Based Modelling for Scam Spread](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/Agent-Based-Modelling-for-Scam-Spread)**  
  *Goal:* Simulate how online scams spread through social/communication networks.  
  *Skills:* Agent-based modelling (Mesa), rule design, diffusion dynamics, scenario testing.  
  *Current status:* Project at concept stage — agents and diffusion rules planned, not yet functional.
 
  *Next:* Integrate ML/GNN-derived risk scores into ABM to test intervention policies.

## Roadmap
This profile documents an ongoing research path that combines technical modelling with crime science applications. Planned next steps include:  
- Consolidating ML + GNN baselines on financial transaction graphs  
- Developing ABM simulations for scam diffusion and laundering networks  
- Building a hybrid GNN–ABM framework for testing interventions (e.g. freezing accounts, scam message filtering)  
- Linking outputs to policy evaluation in financial crime prevention
