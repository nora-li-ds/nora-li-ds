# Hi, I’m Nora (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

I work at the intersection of **Data Science**, **Financial Crime**, and **Blockchain Intelligence**. With a background in Statistics and Machine Learning, I develop computational tools to detect, trace, and interpret illicit financial activities.

### 🎓 Academic Journey
* **MSc Crime Science with Data Science** | University College London (UCL)
* **MSc Environmental Data Science & Machine Learning** | Imperial College London
* **BSc Statistics** | Lancaster University

---

### 🛡️ Research Focus
My goal is to bridge the gap between **Complex Algorithms** and **Legal Evidence**. My current research focuses on:

* **Graph-based AML:** Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify laundering clusters (e.g., peeling chains).
* **Causal Inference:** Moving from "Black Box" predictions to **Causal Attribution**—providing a "reasoned basis" for asset seizure under regulations like MiCA.
* **Forensic Tracing:** Developing techniques for cross-chain transaction linkability and forensic reporting.

### 🧪 Research Prototypes

#### [Elliptic AML Analysis](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/elliptic-aml-analysis)
* **Goal:** Detect illicit Bitcoin transactions on the Elliptic dataset.
* **Method:** Evaluated baseline ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and identified the limitations of tabular features.
* **Next Steps:** Implementing **GraphSAGE** and **Explainable AI (XAI)** layers to visualize why specific nodes are flagged as high-risk.

#### [Causal Attribution Framework (In Progress)]
* **Goal:** Apply counterfactual analysis to blockchain transactions.
* **Objective:** To distinguish between high-frequency trading and intentional money laundering by simulating "What-if" intervention scenarios.
* **Tech:** Python (CausalML, DoWhy), Google BigQuery.

---

### 🗂️ Technical Toolkit
* **Programming:** Python (PyTorch, PyG, Scikit-learn), C++17, R.
* **Data Engineering:** SQL (BigQuery, PostgreSQL), Data Wrangling.
* **Forensics:** Network Analysis, Transaction Tracing, AML/KYC logic.
* **Certifications:** ACAMS Candidate (Expected April 2026).
