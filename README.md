# Hi, Iâ€™m Nora (ï½¡â€¢Ì€á´—-)âœ§

I combine data science and crime science to study financial crime and online fraud, using methods such as graph learning and agent-based modelling to improve detection and prevention.

## Research Interests
- Financial crime detection and anti-money laundering (AML), including cryptocurrency tracing  
- Modelling scam diffusion and online fraud with agent-based simulation  
- Graph-based and deep learning methods for complex networks  
- Risk analytics and evaluation of intervention strategies

## Academic Journey
My path into crime science has been shaped by a mix of quantitative training and applied motivation.  

- During my BSc in Statistics at Lancaster, I developed a strong foundation in probability, inference, and modelling, and became interested in how quantitative methods can be used to study crime and social phenomena.  
- At Imperial, in my MSc in Environmental Data Science & Machine Learning, I strengthened my technical skills in data science and explored deep learning approaches such as conditional GANs (CGANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). This experience gave me confidence in handling complex datasets and broadened my perspective on advanced algorithms.  
- Now at UCL, in the MSc Crime Science with Data Science, my training emphasises crime prevention, cybercrime, and research design. Alongside this, I am independently developing technical projectsâ€”such as financial crime detection on the Elliptic dataset and agent-based simulations of scam diffusionâ€”to bridge advanced modelling with real-world crime problems.  

This journey reflects my continuing interest in linking rigorous data science methods with practical challenges in financial crime and security.

## Research Prototypes

- **[Elliptic AML Analysis](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/elliptic-aml-analysis)**  
  *Goal:* Detect illicit Bitcoin transactions on the Elliptic dataset.  
  *Skills:* Data wrangling, feature engineering, ML pipelines (LogReg, RF, XGBoost).  
  *Current status:* Baseline ML completed, highlighting limits of tabular features.  
  *Next:* Extend with graph neural networks (GCN, GraphSAGE) and temporal graph modelling.  

- **[Agent-Based Modelling for Scam Spread](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/Agent-Based-Modelling-for-Scam-Spread)**  
  *Goal:* Simulate how online scams spread through social/communication networks.  
  *Skills:* Agent-based modelling (Mesa), rule design, diffusion dynamics, scenario testing.  
  *Current status:* Project at concept stage â€” agents and diffusion rules planned, not yet functional.
 
  *Next:* Integrate ML/GNN-derived risk scores into ABM to test intervention policies.

## Roadmap
This profile documents an ongoing research path that combines technical modelling with crime science applications. Planned next steps include:  
- Consolidating ML + GNN baselines on financial transaction graphs  
- Developing ABM simulations for scam diffusion and laundering networks  
- Building a hybrid GNNâ€“ABM framework for testing interventions (e.g. freezing accounts, scam message filtering)  
- Linking outputs to policy evaluation in financial crime prevention

## ðŸ—‚ Other Projects (Coursework & Teamwork)

- **[Deep Learning Coursework](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/dl-assessment-1-edsml-xl522)**  
  Explored CNNs, VAEs, and CGANs during my MSc at Imperial.  
  Focused on image classification and generative modelling, gaining experience with PyTorch and experimental design.

- **[Flood Risk Prediction Tool](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/ads-deluge-Avon)** (group project)  
  Built in a 7-person team. My contribution focused on **data visualisation** (flood risk maps, rainfall vs tide plots).  
  The project integrated ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN) into a Python package with automated testing.

- **[Wildfire Prediction](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/ads-wildfire-thomas)** (group project)  
  Contributed to model development and reporting. The project combined environmental data with ML pipelines to assess wildfire risk.  

- **[Advanced Programming â€“ Huffman Coding](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/advanced-programming-group-huffman)**  
  Implemented Huffman coding algorithms as part of advanced programming coursework, focusing on data structures and algorithm optimisation.
