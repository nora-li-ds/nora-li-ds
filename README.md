# Hi, I’m Nora (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

I work at the intersection of **Data Science**, **Financial Crime**, and **Forensic Analytics**. My current focus is understanding how illicit activities evolve and translate into measurable financial risks, using Graph ML, Network Science, and Causal Inference.

🎓 **MSc Crime Science with Data Science** @ UCL  
🎓 **MSc Environmental Data Science & Machine Learning** @ Imperial College London  
🎓 **BSc Statistics** @ Lancaster University

## 🛡️ Research Focus

* **Graph-based AML & Crypto Tracing:** Identifying laundering clusters (e.g., peeling chains) using GNNs and transaction network analysis.
* **Explainable AI (XAI) for Compliance:** Utilizing **Causal Inference** to provide a "reasoned basis" for AML alerts, aligning with MiCA regulatory requirements.
* **Computational Risk Assessment:** Developing frameworks to evaluate the causal impact of intervention policies (e.g., account freezing) on criminal network resilience.

## 🎓 Academic Journey

My path into crime science is shaped by rigorous quantitative training and a motivation for practical security challenges.

* **BSc Statistics (Lancaster):** Developed a strong foundation in probability, inference, and statistical modelling.
* **MSc EDSML (Imperial):** Strengthened technical skills in deep learning, exploring **CNNs, VAEs, and CGANs**. Gained experience handling complex, high-dimensional datasets with advanced algorithms.
* **MSc Crime Science (UCL):** Currently specialising in cybercrime, crime prevention, and research design. I am bridging advanced modelling with real-world problems, focusing on blockchain forensics and the interpretability of financial risk models.

## 🧪 Research Prototypes

* **[Elliptic AML Analysis](https://github.com/nora-li-ds/elliptic-aml-analysis)**
    * *Goal:* Detect illicit Bitcoin transactions on the Elliptic dataset.
    * *Current Status:* Baseline ML (LogReg, RF, XGBoost) completed. Now extending with **GraphSAGE** and **Causal Discovery** to mitigate false positives.
* **[Strategic Risk & Intervention Modelling]**
    * *Goal:* Evaluating the effectiveness of AML intervention policies using computational simulations.
    * *Approach:* Integrating ML-derived risk scores into dynamic models to test scenario-based outcomes for fraud prevention and platform safety.
