# Hi, I’m Nora (Xinnuo) Li (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

I work at the intersection of **Data Science**, **Financial Crime**, and **Forensic Analytics**.  
Right now I’m focused on a practical gap in crypto compliance: moving beyond black-box **risk scores** toward **auditable, regulator-friendly signals** — *what the signal means, what changes under a counterfactual stress, and how to document decisions in regulated settings (MiCA-aligned).*

## 🛡️ Current Focus (2026)

- **Crypto / Stablecoin Compliance (MiCA-aligned):** monitoring logic that supports **explanation + audit trails**, not just alerts.  
- **Causal/Stress-Testing for Forensics:** robustness checks and counterfactual reasoning to produce **reviewable** signals.  
- **Graph + Network Analytics:** transaction-network methods, with care around attribution and label scarcity.

## ⭐ Flagship Project

### **Causal Stress Testing for Stablecoin Monitoring (Ethereum)**
**Goal:** develop a *white-box* metric that separates **fee-sensitive, market-driven activity** (e.g., arbitrage/hedging) from activity that appears **less fee-elastic** and potentially driven by **non-market constraints** — **without** making claims about illegality.

**Core idea:** within relatively stable regimes, transaction costs can spike (gas).  
Profit-driven actors tend to slow down when costs rise; some entities remain unusually **cost-rigid**.  
I quantify **cost sensitivity / rigidity (elasticity)** as an interpretable signal to support **escalation + audit narratives**, complementing black-box graph models.
